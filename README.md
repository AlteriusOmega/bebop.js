# bebop.js
This project is a web application which takes in a chord or chords (aimed towards jazz chords)and a key signature and outputs various
"bebop style" melodies. These are  created by interpreting the type of chord and determining the proper scale to use, then adding notes
that approach chord tone notes to create a flowing bebop lick with waves of tension and release.

The notes are displayed on the page, and can be played with sound output using tone.js
